## About The Project

Currently, I'm taking "The Complete Node.js Developer Course (3rd Edition)" by Andrew Mead to continue my exciting journey learning Node.Js after finishing "The Complete Node.js Course" by Mosh Hamedani, you can check what I've built during that course right there https://github.com/mohieey/vidly_nodejs_course.
Throughout this course, I'm going to build 4 projects, and this is the 3rd one!
It's an express server to manage tasks.

I've learned to use some new packages and also refreshed some of my information about other packages that I know about before.
